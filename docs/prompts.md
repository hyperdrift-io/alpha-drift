CONTENT=files updated in the context of milestone 1 and 2
Create a new article regarding CONTENT following guideline:

- Link and briefly explain technical terms for non-technical readers (add links in parentheses after metaphors or technical terms).
- Write for a smart, non-developer audience: focus on impact, risks, and vision.
- Use a conversational, energetic tone and end with a teaser for what's next.
- Include why the work matters, what problems it solves, and how it sets the stage for future milestones.
- Follow the guidelines in docs/user-journey-rules.md for accessibility and domain education.
- Output should be in MDX format, suitable for docs/public/[milestone].mdx.

# 🚦 Milestones 1 & 2: When the Bot Gets a Brain (and a Finger on the Trigger)

Imagine you’re teaching a self-driving car to not just see the road, but to decide when to change lanes, overtake, or slam the brakes. That’s exactly what we tackled in AlphaDrift’s latest milestones—except our “car” is a crypto trading agent, and the “road” is the wild, ever-shifting world of [DeFi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_finance).

## 🧩 The Problem: From Watching to Acting

In the earliest days, AlphaDrift was like a careful observer at the racetrack—watching prices, logging data, but never making a move. That’s safe, but in DeFi, opportunity doesn’t wait. If you want to win, you need to decide *when* to act, *how much* to risk, and *where* to execute—all while dodging the potholes of bad data, front-running bots, and network fees.

But how do you teach a bot to make smart, risk-aware decisions in a world where every trade is public, irreversible, and potentially costly? That’s the challenge we set out to solve.

## 🧠 Milestone 1: The Decision Engine Wakes Up

**Milestone 1** was all about giving AlphaDrift a “brain” and a “hand”—the ability to decide and (almost) execute trades.

### **Selector: The Bot’s Inner Coach**

We introduced the [Selector](https://github.com/hyperdrift-io/alphadrift/blob/main/src/selector/selector.ts), a module that acts like a coach whispering in the bot’s ear: “Now’s your chance!” It weighs the latest market snapshot (the [FeatureVector](https://github.com/hyperdrift-io/alphadrift/blob/main/src/types.ts)) and, using a predictive model, decides if the odds are in our favor.

- **How?** The Selector calls a stubbed [AlloraPredictor](https://github.com/hyperdrift-io/alphadrift/blob/main/src/selector/alloraPredictor.ts), which in the future will use real AI to forecast risk and reward.
- **Why does this matter?** In DeFi, timing is everything. A bot that can’t decide is just a spectator.

### **Execution Router: The (Paper) Trigger Finger**

Next, we built the [Execution Router](https://github.com/hyperdrift-io/alphadrift/blob/main/src/execution/router.ts)—think of it as the bot’s finger hovering over the “Buy” or “Sell” button. For now, it only logs what it *would* do, but the wiring is ready for real trades.

- **Why not go live yet?** Because in DeFi, a single bug can cost real money. We’re building guardrails first.

### **RiskGuard: The Seatbelt**

No racecar is safe without a seatbelt. The [RiskGuard](https://github.com/hyperdrift-io/alphadrift/blob/main/src/risk/riskGuard.ts) checks every trade for red flags—like too much drawdown, high gas fees, or suspicious price gaps. If something looks off, it vetoes the trade.

- **Why is this crucial?** DeFi is full of hidden risks. Automated checks help prevent costly mistakes.

## 🤖 Milestone 2: The AI Sidekick Arrives

If Milestone 1 gave AlphaDrift a brain, **Milestone 2** gave it a *sidekick*: a Python-powered AI service called “DriftBrain.”

### **DriftBrain: The Oracle in the Pit Lane**

We spun up a [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) service in Python, ready to handle real machine learning. For now, it returns mock predictions, but the scaffolding is there for [Optuna](https://optuna.org/) hyperparameter tuning and [LightGBM](https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/) models.

- **Endpoints:** `/predict` (for Sharpe ratio and edge probability), `/train` (to kick off model training), and `/health` (to check if the brain is alive).
- **Why Python?** Because the best ML tools live there, and we want AlphaDrift to learn from the best.

### **Node & Python: Talking the Same Language**

The Node.js agent now calls the Python `/predict` endpoint using [axios](https://axios-http.com/), blending the speed of TypeScript with the smarts of Python. It’s like having a pit crew of data scientists on call every time the bot considers a move.

### **CI/CD: No Surprises on Race Day**

We wired up [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) to test every change—Node, Python, and Docker Compose. That means every pit stop (code update) is checked for leaks before we hit the track.

## 🏁 Why This Matters

- **From Paper to Practice:** We’re no longer just logging data—we’re making (simulated) decisions, checking risks, and preparing for real trades.
- **AI-Ready:** The architecture is now set for real machine learning, not just stubs.
- **Safety First:** With risk checks and CI, we’re building trust—no cowboy trading here.
- **DeFi for Humans:** By linking every technical leap to real-world problems (like front-running, slippage, and data reliability), we’re making DeFi safer and smarter for everyone.

## 🚀 What’s Next?

The next lap is the most exciting: plugging in real data feeds, training the AI on thousands of market scenarios, and—yes—flipping the switch to live trading. Will AlphaDrift outsmart the market? Will it dodge the next DeFi crash? Stay tuned, because the real race is just beginning.

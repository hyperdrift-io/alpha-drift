# 📝 Dev Journey MDX Writing Rules

Welcome to the AlphaDrift Dev Journey! All MDX files in this folder are meant for the public—traders, curious onlookers, and future contributors alike. To make these stories engaging and accessible, please follow these rules:

## ✨ Narrative First
- Write as a story, not a changelog. Take the reader on a journey—show the challenges, the "aha!" moments, and the why behind each step.
- Use analogies and real-world comparisons to make complex ideas relatable (e.g., "building a self-driving car" for a trading bot).

## 🧠 Explain the Domain
- Always connect the technical work to the real-world problems of DeFi, trading, or data reliability.
- Highlight why the problem matters—what could go wrong, and why your solution is important.

## 🔗 Link Technical Terms
- When you mention a technical term (like "DeFi", "Docker", "ProviderPool"), link to a reputable source or a glossary if possible.
- Briefly explain jargon in plain English the first time it appears.

## 👥 Write for Non-Techies
- Assume the reader is smart but not a developer. Avoid unexplained acronyms or code dumps.
- Focus on the impact, the risks, and the vision—not just the implementation.

## 🎬 Make It Engaging
- Use a conversational, energetic tone. Invite the reader to follow along, ask questions, or get involved.
- End each milestone with a teaser for what's next—keep the story moving!
